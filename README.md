Revenue &amp; Sales Analysis Dashboard : 2024

ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Revenue & Sales Analysis Dashboard for 2024! ðŸ“Š

I built this Microsoft Excel dashboard to visualize sales data, uncover trends, evaluate performance, and drive data-driven decision-making. This project enhanced my data analytics, visualization, and storytelling skills, demonstrating how raw data can turn into actionable insights.

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights from the Dashboard:
ðŸ”¹ City-wise Sales Trends â€“ Tracks sales across Bangalore, Cochin, and Delhi, highlighting growth patterns.
ðŸ”¹ City-wise Max-Min Sales â€“ Identifies top and bottom-performing cities to spot improvement areas.
ðŸ”¹ Month-wise Sales â€“ Sales peaked in April and July, showing seasonal demand.
ðŸ”¹ Category-wise Sales â€“ Revenue is driven by Phones (41%), Laptops (39%), and Headphones (20%).
ðŸ”¹ Product-wise Sales â€“ Top products: Dell XPS 13 & iPhone 11 Pro.
ðŸ”¹ Sales Representativesâ€™ Performance â€“ Standout reps: Amar, Kate, and Tara.

I had the opportunity to collaborate with Adeep Reddy, who is currently in his first year of MCA at Aditya University. Working together helped us refine our analytical skills and enhance our understanding of business intelligence.

ðŸ”— This experience strengthens my expertise in data analysis, Excel dashboards, data visualization, and business intelligence. Looking forward to applying these skills to real-world challenges!
